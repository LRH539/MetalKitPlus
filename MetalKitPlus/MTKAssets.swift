/**
    MTKAssets defines a protocol to store MTKPipelineStateDescriptors
    in a dictionary and make them accessible via the subscript operator.
 
    MTKAssets are supposed to aid the organization of assets belonging to
    a certain group of shaders (e.g. MTKHdrAssets, MTKDenoiseAssets) by
    enabling the user to retrieve all the required assets
    (textures, buffers etc.) through the MTKPipelineStateDescriptor
    by using the subscript operator with the associated function name.
 
    This is used to ease the execution of functions via an execute command
    of an `MTKComputer`:
 
    ```
    let hdrAssets = MTKHdrAssets(args...)
    let hdrComputer = MTKComputer(commandQueue,hdrAssets)
 
    hdrComputer.execute("tonemapping")
    ```
 
    where tonemapping has been initialized inside MTKHdrAssets.
