# MetalKitPlus
Framework for rapid development of Metal applications, extending Apple's MetalKit. Offers features similar to CoreImage, but doesn't restrict the user as much.

## Roadmap

We've started working on the following in our dev/v2.0.0 branch:

 - Add documentation
 - Write tests
 - Metal 2 Support
 
## Contribution

Always appreciated. I currently don't use this Framework anymore, but maybe it's useful for someone else.
